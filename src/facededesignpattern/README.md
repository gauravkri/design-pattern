# Facade Design Pattern

## Intent
Facade is structural design patter, it provide a simplified interface with limited functionality to the library of subsystem. it works as encapsulates like we have large system with complex solution. we wanted to use that subsystem in an application, we don't need to know all implementation faced provides a interface for a task with that we can easily integrate with application.

## User case
When you want provide a simple interface for the complex system.

## Example

Let's say we have complex home theater system with various component like DVD player, projector, amplifier, and lights. 

To watch a movie we can create FacadeHomeTheater to watch movie in which we can combine all these task.
